## 🛠️ How to Install (Step-by-Step)

Follow these steps to get the system online:

### 1. Install Python
Ensure you have **Python 3.8** or higher installed. Check with:
```bash
python --version
2. Install Dependencies
Run this command to install required libraries:

Bash
pip install openai requests
3. Obtain API Keys
You will need хоёр keys to unlock full functionality:

DeepSeek API Key: platform.deepseek.com

Tavily Search API Key: tavily.com
```
# 🚀 How to Run the System
Navigate to your project folder and execute:

python ultra.py
The Startup Process:
Neural Link: On the first run, it will prompt for your API keys.

Persistent Memory: It automatically restores context from ultra_memory.json.
# 🎮 Core Features

# 🧠 1. Persistent Memory
The AI learns and retains information across sessions.

Usage: No special command needed.

Reset: Type clear memory to wipe the neural cache.

# 🛰️ 2. Deep Web Research (-web)
Access live data from the internet (up to 2026).

Command: -web <your query>

Logic: Crawls multiple sources and synthesizes a real-time report.

# 🤖 3. Auto-Pilot Mode (-autopilot)
Perform autonomous "File Surgery" on entire projects.

Command: -autopilot <folder_path>

Workflow: Analyzes and updates multiple files simultaneously.

# 🛠️ 4. Self-Healing Execution
The AI detects and fixes its own coding errors.

Action: Prompted as Execute with Healing? (y/n).

Healing: Captures errors, re-thinks the logic, and fixes the code automatically.

# 💻 5. Direct OS Access (!cmd)
Run terminal commands directly.
Command: !cmd <command> (e.g., !cmd ipconfig)
```
