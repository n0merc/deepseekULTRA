## 🛠️ How to Install (Step-by-Step)

Follow these steps to get the system online:

### 1. Install Python
Ensure you have **Python 3.8** or higher installed on your system. You can check by typing `python --version` in your terminal.

### 2. Clone or Save the Script
Save the main code as `ultra.py` in a new folder.

### 3. Install Dependencies
Open your terminal/command prompt and run the following command to install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install openai requests
4. Obtain API KeysYou will need two keys for the system to function at 100%:DeepSeek API Key: Get it at platform.deepseek.comTavily Search API Key: Get it at tavily.com🚀 How to Run the SystemSimply navigate to your folder and run:Bashpython ultra.py
The Startup Process:Neural Link: On the first run, it will ask for your API keys. Once entered, the "Neural Link" is established.Persistent Memory: It will automatically look for ultra_memory.json to restore your previous session.🎮 Core Features & How to Use Them🧠 1. Persistent MemoryThe AI learns from you. It stores your name, preferences, and project details.Usage: No special command needed. Just talk.Command: Type clear memory if you want the AI to "forget" everything and start fresh.🛰️ 2. Deep Web Research (-web)Use this when you need data that happened today or deep technical research from the live internet.Example: -web Latest zero-day vulnerabilities in Linux 2026Logic: The system crawls the web, reads multiple sources, and gives you a synthesized intelligence report.🤖 3. Auto-Pilot Mode (-autopilot)Need to fix a whole project or upgrade a folder of scripts?Command: -autopilot ./my_project_folderWhat happens: The AI reads all files, understands the code, and asks you for permission to "Overwrite" and improve them. Perfect for "File Surgery."🛠️ 4. Self-Healing ExecutionThis is the "God Mode" of coding.Scenario: You ask the AI to write a script.Action: It asks Execute with Healing? (y/n).Healing: If the code fails, the AI sees the error, thinks about a solution, fixes the code, and runs it again automatically until it works perfectly.💻 5. Direct System Access (!cmd)Run any terminal command without leaving the AI environment.Example: !cmd ipconfig or !cmd pip list📊 Command Reference TableModeCommand SyntaxFunctionSearch-web <your query>Deep web research with live 2026 data.Auto-Pilot-autopilot <path>Analyze and rewrite entire directories.Shell!cmd <command>Direct OS shell command execution.Resetclear memoryWipes the neural memory file.Exitexit or quitSafely saves memory and closes the link.⚠️ Safety & DisclaimerDeepSeek-Ultra is a high-level tool with the ability to modify files and execute system commands. It is designed for security researchers, developers, and educational use. Always review the AI's suggestions before hitting 'y' to overwrite files.Developed by: n0mercStatus: ULTRA-GOD MODE ACTIVE
