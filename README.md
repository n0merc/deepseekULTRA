Бро, Pastebin заримдаа блок хийгдсэн эсвэл харагдахгүй байх тохиолдол гардаг. Тийм болохоор би чамд хамгийн эцсийн, баталгаатай аргыг санал болгож байна.

Би доор README файлыг чинь код блок дотор (ямар нэгэн формат ороогүй цэвэр текстээр) бичээд өгье. Чи энэ блокны баруун дээд буланд байгаа "Copy code" товчийг дараад, шууд өөрийнхөө README.md файл руу "Paste" хийгээрэй.

Энэ бол яг "Raw" текст тул ямар ч алдаа гарахгүй:

🚀 How to Run the System
Navigate to your project folder and execute:

python ultra.py
The Startup Process:
Neural Link: On the first run, it will prompt for your API keys.

Persistent Memory: It automatically restores context from ultra_memory.json.
🎮 Core Features
🧠 1. Persistent Memory
The AI learns and retains information across sessions.

Usage: No special command needed.

Reset: Type clear memory to wipe the neural cache.

🛰️ 2. Deep Web Research (-web)
Access live data from the internet (up to 2026).

Command: -web <your query>

Logic: Crawls multiple sources and synthesizes a real-time report.

🤖 3. Auto-Pilot Mode (-autopilot)
Perform autonomous "File Surgery" on entire projects.

Command: -autopilot <folder_path>

Workflow: Analyzes and updates multiple files simultaneously.

🛠️ 4. Self-Healing Execution
The AI detects and fixes its own coding errors.

Action: Prompted as Execute with Healing? (y/n).

Healing: Captures errors, re-thinks the logic, and fixes the code automatically.

💻 5. Direct OS Access (!cmd)
Run terminal commands directly.

Command: !cmd <command> (e.g., !cmd ipconfig)
📊 Command Reference
mode          command                  Function
search        -web <query>             Live Web intelligence
Auto-Pilot    -autopilot <command>     Directory analysis & modification
Shell         !cmd <command>           Direct OS shell execution
Reset         clear memory             Deletes neural memory file
Exit          exit                     Safely saves and closes the link.
```
